  I submit the work below for assessment as my best work. I declare that this
  is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

# Use this to list names of people who you collaborated with, and a
# comment about what you collaborated on.
#
# Add as many "name+comment" entries as necessary
# (or remove it altogether if you haven't collaborated with anyone)
# Use this to list any code that you used that you did not write,
# aside from code provided by the lecturer.  Provide a comment
# explaining your use and the URL to that code and the licence for
# that code
#
# Add as many "url+licence+comment" entries as necessary
# (or remove it altogether if you haven't used any external code)
#code:
#  - comment: dsf
#    url: dsf
#    licence:

# I wish to submit the following classes as entirely my own (remove this if
# you want to just submit methods):
class:
   - App, Page

     via the app-page design, we can easily add more pages in the game and properly manager them. For example, the main page and the game page could be separately designed and tested, and can use app.switchPage to switch current page to another

# I wish to submit the following methods as entirely my own (remove this if
# you want to just submit classes):
